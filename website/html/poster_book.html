            These are posters made for the virtual book signing event. 
            Each poster should have had a completely different design and should have been produced using different methods. 
            So I made one using only a vector, and the other by digitizing the analog work. Of course, the typefaces and details were also used differently. 
            The poster no.1 was made a bit crudely and with a strong contrast so that it could be seen in a glance from a distance. 
            Moreover, the poster no.2 is composed after drawing with charcoal and editing it with photoshop. 
            No.2 has a more moderate and softer atmosphere compared to the first one, and the details are much more diverse. 
            It was to study which side was more effective in communicating information.
