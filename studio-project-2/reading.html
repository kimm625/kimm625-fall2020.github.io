            In life, the number of beginnings <br> is exactly equal to <br>the number of endings: <br> 
            <br>no one has yet to begin a life <br>who will not end it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In poetry, <br>the number of beginnings <br>so far exceeds the number of endings <br>that we cannot even conceive of it. 
            <br><br>Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, <br>another catches fire <br>and is carried away <br>by the wind, <br>
            which may be an ending, <br>but it is the ending <br>of a poem <br>without an end.
        </p>

        <p>
            Paul Valéry, <br>the French poet and thinker, <br>
            once said that <br>no poem is ever ended, <br>
            that every poem is merely abandoned. <br>
            This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>for where quotations begin is in a cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
            Paul Valéry also described <br>his perception of first lines so vividly, <br>
            and to my mind so accurately, <br>that i have never forgotten it: <br><br>the opening line of a poem, 
            he said, <br>is like finding a fruit on the ground, <br>a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, <br>
            and the poet’s task <br>is to create the tree <br>from which such a fruit would fall. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In the beginning was the Word. <br>
            Western civilization rests upon those words. <br>
            And yet <br>there is a lively group of thinkers <br>who believe that in the beginning was the Act. <br>
            that nothing can precede <br>action—no breath before act, <br>no thought before act, <br>no pervasive love before some kind of act. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe <br>the poem is an act of the mind. <br>
            I think it is easier <br>to talk about the end of a poem <br>than it is to talk about its beginning. <br>
            Because the poem ends on the page, <br>but it begins off the page, <br>it begins in the mind. <br>
            The mind acts, <br>the mind wills a poem, <br>often against our own will; <br>somehow this happens, <br>
            somehow a poem gets written <br>in the middle of a chaotic holiday party <br>that has just run out of ice, <br>and it's your house. 
        </p>

        <p>
            An act of the mind. <br>
            To move, <br>to make happen, <br>to make manifest. <br>
            Be an act of Congress. <br>A state of real existence <br>rather than possibility. <br>
            And poets love possibility! <br>They love to wonder and explore. <br>
            Hard lot! <br>But the poem, <br>no matter how full of possibility, <br>has to exist! <br>
            To conduct oneself, <br>to behave. <br>How a poem acts marks its individual character. <br><br>
            A poem by Glandolyn Blue <br>does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. <br>to pretend, <br>feign, <br>impersonate. <br>
            That, too, yes and always, <br>because self-consciousness is its own pretension, <br>and has been from its beginning; <br><br>
            the human mind is capable of <br>a great elastic theatre. <br>As the poet Ralph angel puts it, <br><br>
            <strong>“The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” </strong><br><br>the weird theatrical shit <br>is what goes on around us every day of our lives; <br>
            an animal of only instinct, <br>Johnny Ferret, <br>has in his actions drama, <br>but no theater; <br>
            theater requires that <br>you draw a circle around the action <br>and observe it from outside the circle; <br>
            in other words, <br>self-consciousness is theatre. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Everyone knows that <br>if you query poets about how their poems begin, <br>the answer is always the same: <br><br>
            a phrase, <br>a line, <br>a scrap of language, <br>a rhythm, <br>an image, <br>something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. <br><br>
            And the lesson is always the same, <br>and young poets recognize this to be <br>one of the most important lessons they can learn: <br>
            if you have any idea for a poem, <br>an exact grid of intent, <br>you are on the wrong path, <br>
            a dead-end alley, <br>at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. <br><br>
            This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe many fine poems <br>begin with ideas, <br>but if you tell too many faces this, <br>or tell it too loudly, <br>
            they will get the wrong idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now here is something really interesting (to me), <br>
            something you can use at <br>a standing-up-only party when everyone <br>
            is tired of hearing <br>there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words <br>used by the Esimo for snow. <br>
            This is what <br>Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: <br><br>
            Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that <br>we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. <br>
            That sentence begins with your first words, <br>toddling around the kitchen, <br>
            and ends with your last words <br>right before you step into the limousine, <br>or in a nursing home, <br>the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. <br>
            Or, <br>if you are blessed, <br>they are heard by someone who knows you <br>and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            When I told Mr. Angel <br>about the lifelong sentence, <br>he said: <br><br>
            “That’s a lot of semicolons!” <br><br>he is absolutely right; <br>
            the sentence would be unwieldy <br>and awkward <br>and resemble the novel of a savant, <br>
            but the next time you use a semicolon <br>(which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) <br>
            you should stop a<br>nd be thankful that <br>there exists this little thing, <br>
            invented by a human being—an Italian <br>as a matter of fact—that allows us <br>to go on and keep on connecting speech that <br>
            for all apparent purposes is unrelated. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Would not speak to each other. <br>
            Because the lines of a poem <br>are speaking to each other, <br>not you to them or they to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I will tell you what I miss: <br><br>
            I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: <br><br>
            <strong>The End.</strong> <br><br>I miss finishing a novel <br>and there on the last page, <br>at a discrete distance <br>from the last words of the last sentence, <br>
            are the dark letters spelling <br>The End.
        </p>

        <p id="middle-1">
            It was its own thrill. <br>
            I didn’t ignore them, <br>I read them, <br>even if only silently, <br>with a deep sense of feeling: <br>
            both the feeling of being replete, <br>a feeling of satisfaction, <br>
            and the feeling of loss, <br>the sadness of having finished the book.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have never, <br>in my life, <br>read a poem <br>that ended with the words The End. <br>
            Why is that, I wonder. <br>
            I think perhaps the brevity of poems <br>compared to novels <br>makes one feel that <br>there has been no great sustention of energy, <br>
            no marathon worthy of <br>pulling tape across the finish line. <br>
            And then I found a poem of mine <br>that I had carefully written by hand <br>in the sixth grade,<br> 
            and at the bottom of the page, <br>in India ink, <br>beautifully apart from the rest of the text, <br>were the words The End. <br>
            And I realized <br>children very often denote the end <br>because it is indeed a great achievement for them <br>to have written anything, <br>
            and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems <br>that have already been written; <br>they know some, <br>
            of course, but have not yet found out <br>the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. <br>
            And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. <br>Which is a wonderful thing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Roland Barthes suggests <br>there are three ways <br>to finish any piece of writing: <br><br> <strong>
            the ending will have the last word <br>or the ending will be silent <br>or the ending will execute a pirouette, 
            <br>do something unexpectedly incongruent.</strong>

            Gaston Bachelard says <br>the single most succinct and astonishing thing: <br>
            We begin in admiration <br>and we end by organizing our disappointment. <br>
            The moment of admiration is <br>the experience of something unfiltered, <br>
            vital and fresh—it could also be <br>horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment <br>
            and its dignification; <br>the least we can do is <br>dignify our knowingness, <br>
            the loss of some vitality through familiarization, <br>
            by admiring not the thing itself <br>but how we can organize it, <br>think about it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am afraid <br>there is no way around this. <br>
            It is the one try inevitable thing. <br>
            And if you believe that, <br>then you are conceding <br>that in the beginning was the act, <br>not the word.

            The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, <br>
            on a scrap of paper: <br><br> <strong>“The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. <br>
            Cy Twombly uses text <br>in some of his drawings and paintings, <br>usually poetry, usually Dante. <br>
            Many men and women have written long essays and lectures <br>on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.

            Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: <br><br> <strong>origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings).</strong><br><br>
            The poem <br>is the consequence of its origins. <br>
            Give me the fruit <br>and I will take from it a see and plant it <br>and watch grow the tree from which it fell.
        </p>

        <p>
            Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: <br>
            A Study of How Poems End, <br>says this: <br><br> <strong>
            “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, <br>is that varying degrees or states of tension <br>seem to be involved in all our experiences, <br>
            and that the most gratifying ones <br>are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released. <br>
            Or, to use another familiar set of terms, <br>
            an experience is gratifying <br>to the extent that those expectations <br>that are aroused are also fulfilled.”</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            But there is no book <br>I know of on the subject of how poems begin. <br>
            How can the origin be traced <br>when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? <br>
            It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—<br>we can go back to a nanosecond before the beginning, <br>
            before the universe burst into being, <br>
            but we can’t go back to the precise beginning <br>because that would precede knowledge, <br>
            and we can’t “know” anything <br>before “knowing” itself was born.

            I have flipped through books, <br>reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, <br>across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, <br>
            and I have discovered that <br>first lines are remarkably similar, <br>even repeated, <br>and that last lines are remarkably similar, <br>even repeated. <br>
            Of course in all cases <br>they remain remarkably distinct, <br>because the words belong to completely different poems. <br>
            And i began to realize, <br>reading these first and last lines, <br>
            that there are not only <br>the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak <br>but also the first and last lines <br>of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, <br>
            by those we listen to. <br>And in the best of all possible lives, <br>that beginning and that end are the same: <br>
            in poem after poem <br>I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language <br>that we hear as children repeated night after night, <br>like a refrain: <br><br>
            <em>I love you. <br>I am here with you. <br>Don’t be afraid. <br>Go to sleep now.</em> <br><br>
            And I encountered words that mark the last something <br>made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: <br><br><em>I love you. <br>

            And I realized <br>children very often denote the end <br>because it is indeed a great achievement for them <br>to have written anything, <br>
            and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems <br>that have already been written; <br>they know some, <br>
            of course, but have not yet found out <br>the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet. <br>
            And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. <br>Which is a wonderful thing.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was its own thrill. <br>
            I didn’t ignore them, <br>I read them, <br>even if only silently, <br>with a deep sense of feeling: <br>
            both the feeling of being replete, <br>a feeling of satisfaction, <br>
            and the feeling of loss, <br>the sadness of having finished the book.

            I will tell you what I miss: <br><br>
            I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: <br><br>
            <strong>The End.</strong> <br><br>I miss finishing a novel <br>and there on the last page, <br>at a discrete distance <br>from the last words of the last sentence, <br>
            are the dark letters spelling <br>The End.
        </p>

        <p>
            Would not speak to each other. <br>
            Because the lines of a poem <br>are speaking to each other, <br>not you to them or they to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I told Mr. Angel <br>about the lifelong sentence, <br>he said: <br><br>
            “That’s a lot of semicolons!” <br><br>he is absolutely right; <br>
            the sentence would be unwieldy <br>and awkward <br>and resemble the novel of a savant, <br>
            but the next time you use a semicolon <br>(which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) <br>
            you should stop a<br>nd be thankful that <br>there exists this little thing, <br>
            invented by a human being—an Italian <br>as a matter of fact—that allows us <br>to go on and keep on connecting speech that <br>
            for all apparent purposes is unrelated. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now here is something really interesting (to me), <br>
            something you can use at <br>a standing-up-only party when everyone <br>
            is tired of hearing <br>there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words <br>used by the Esimo for snow. <br>
            This is what <br>Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: <br><br>
            Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that <br>we each only really speak one sentence in our lifetime. <br>
            That sentence begins with your first words, <br>toddling around the kitchen, <br>
            and ends with your last words <br>right before you step into the limousine, <br>or in a nursing home, <br>the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. <br>
            Or, <br>if you are blessed, <br>they are heard by someone who knows you <br>and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe many fine poems <br>begin with ideas, <br>but if you tell too many faces this, <br>or tell it too loudly, <br>
            they will get the wrong idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            Everyone knows that <br>if you query poets about how their poems begin, <br>the answer is always the same: <br><br>
            a phrase, <br>a line, <br>a scrap of language, <br>a rhythm, <br>an image, <br>something seen, heard, witnessed, or imagined. <br><br>
            And the lesson is always the same, <br>and young poets recognize this to be <br>one of the most important lessons they can learn: <br>
            if you have any idea for a poem, <br>an exact grid of intent, <br>you are on the wrong path, <br>
            a dead-end alley, <br>at the top of a cliff you haven’t even climbed. <br><br>
            This is a lesson that can only be learned by trial and error.

            An act of the mind. <br>
            To move, <br>to make happen, <br>to make manifest. <br>
            Be an act of Congress. <br>A state of real existence <br>rather than possibility. <br>
            And poets love possibility! <br>They love to wonder and explore. <br>
            Hard lot! <br>But the poem, <br>no matter how full of possibility, <br>has to exist! <br>
            To conduct oneself, <br>to behave. <br>How a poem acts marks its individual character. <br><br>
            A poem by Glandolyn Blue <br>does not sound like a poem by Timothy Sure. <br>to pretend, <br>feign, <br>impersonate. <br>
            That, too, yes and always, <br>because self-consciousness is its own pretension, <br>and has been from its beginning; <br><br>
            the human mind is capable of <br>a great elastic theatre. <br>As the poet Ralph angel puts it, <br><br>
            <strong>“The poem is an interpretation of weird theatrical shit.” </strong><br><br>the weird theatrical shit <br>is what goes on around us every day of our lives; <br>
            an animal of only instinct, <br>Johnny Ferret, <br>has in his actions drama, <br>but no theater; <br>
            theater requires that <br>you draw a circle around the action <br>and observe it from outside the circle; <br>
            in other words, <br>self-consciousness is theatre. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe <br>the poem is an act of the mind. <br>
            I think it is easier <br>to talk about the end of a poem <br>than it is to talk about its beginning. <br>
            Because the poem ends on the page, <br>but it begins off the page, <br>it begins in the mind. <br>
            The mind acts, <br>the mind wills a poem, <br>often against our own will; <br>somehow this happens, <br>
            somehow a poem gets written <br>in the middle of a chaotic holiday party <br>that has just run out of ice, <br>and it's your house. 
        </p>

            In the beginning was the Word. <br>
            Western civilization rests upon those words. <br>
            And yet <br>there is a lively group of thinkers <br>who believe that in the beginning was the Act. <br>
            that nothing can precede <br>action—no breath before act, <br>no thought before act, <br>no pervasive love before some kind of act. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Paul Valéry also described <br>his perception of first lines so vividly, <br>
            and to my mind so accurately, <br>that i have never forgotten it: <br><br>the opening line of a poem, 
            he said, <br>is like finding a fruit on the ground, <br>a piece of fallen fruit you have never seen before, <br>
            and the poet’s task <br>is to create the tree <br>from which such a fruit would fall. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Paul Valéry, <br>the French poet and thinker, <br>
            once said that <br>no poem is ever ended, <br>
            that every poem is merely abandoned. <br>
            This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>for where quotations begin is in a cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
            In poetry, <br>the number of beginnings <br>so far exceeds the number of endings <br>that we cannot even conceive of it. 
            <br><br>Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned, <br>another catches fire <br>and is carried away <br>by the wind, <br>
            which may be an ending, <br>but it is the ending <br>of a poem <br>without an end.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In life, the number of beginnings <br> is exactly equal to <br>the number of endings: <br> 
            <br>no one has yet to begin a life <br>who will not end it.
