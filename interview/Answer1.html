    <h2><u>Where do you want to travel first after when the COVID-19 is over and why?</u></h2><br><br>
        
        <p>Definitely Japan. I am the biggest foodie. <br>I went to Osaka two years ago and I felt like the local Japanese food tasted quite different from what I had in the Japanese restaurant in China. Since then it has become my addiction, once I tried those dishes in a local place, I always keep thinking about it and being pickyâ€”It's hard for me to find a Japanese restaurant that can fulfill my appetite in China.
