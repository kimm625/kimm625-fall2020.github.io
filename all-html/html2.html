            <mark>Beauty is found in natural things. That is, beauty is well suited to the world and to the people who live in it. Human is part of the nature and lives with nature.</mark></span>

            People sometimes make less observations and make more judgements. We are used to the environment or people that are always around us, so we keep looking for something flashy and new,  and overlook or miss the preciousness of them. But there is a calm beauty in the world that takes some time to know. Such as a beauty of curve, something that is not fancy or glamorous and difficult to attract attention at once but that becomes more and more visible and attractive.

        <span>Beautiful things always pass faster.
            Even though the clouds, the sunsets, and our time looking at them every day is just passing by like yesterday, it feels faster.

            <span>A common feature of many inspirations such as mountains, rivers and oceans is a curvilinear beauty.
                Maybe we feel relaxed and secure when seeing curves because we feel close from within, facing naturalness that is not artificial. The reason why humans feel close to the curve is that humans themselves are the product of the curve.
                Our bodies are curves, and our daily lives art curves.</span>
